## Ablation 2: Effectiveness of Dynamic Factor Decomposition (DF).

* Our Proposed Framework Review: Dynamic Factor Decompsition (DF) + Deep Residual Learning (DL)
  * DF: DFM ( t ) $\rightarrow$ Granger Causality + VAR ( t+ $\alpha$ ) $\rightarrow$ Kalman
  * DL: PatchLatentMLP ( t+ $\alpha$ )
* Goal: To demonstrate superior performnace of **DF** phase
  * Compare DF model with non-DF models

### DF + xPatch VS xPatch, CARD, DLinear, NLinear
* Dataset: United States
